# Skin_Cancer_Detection

Project aims to empower Skin cancer prediction using Deep Learning and AWS Services. Leveraging AWS EC2 , EMR , Sagemaker , S3 , Pyspark and MLlib .We enhance predictive precision through distributed processing and strategic feature extraction, complemented by big data-driven EDA. Employing TensorFlow's CNN facilitate timely disease detection. Through automation of tasks integrates technologies, streamling disease classification. Transparent model decisions, influenced by interpretable machine learning and EDA insights.
